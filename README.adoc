== What is it?

This repo is a set of samples for teaching and hacking with Go. I've been learning Go for a
while. To speed up my learning and to give other newcomers a chance to learn the basics in a
new way I thought it a fun idea to cook up a very brief (1 hour) collaborative coding session.

Content is inspired by Todd Mcleod's professional Go training courses and material at
https://github.com/GoesToEleven. I encourage taking a look at Todd's mountain of work.

== Get started
